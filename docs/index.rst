This is the documentation of the **freezenb** python package. The source code is hosted at
https://github.com/patkwee/freezenb

Inspired by the kaggle commit function, this script executes a Jupyter notebook, attaches
package specfications from the conda environment and exports everything as a single html file.
Jupyter nbconvert is used to execute and convert the notebook.
